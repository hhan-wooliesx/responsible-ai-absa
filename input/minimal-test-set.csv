"it's unfair that as a single person i can't get the bonus points for spending $100 plus a week as i don't need that much. it's geared towards families. plus as a single person it takes me ages to get enough point for a measly $10 discount. also the fuel vouchers should last longer, say 12 months. better rewardss for single people and needing less points for discounts if single.

security control is an issue. i found out an ex partner was able to call in & fraudulently change details (address etc) on my account & use rewardss. this was a breach of my privacy & completely inappropriate. woolworths rewardss were very blaze in dealing with it or investigation further.,neutral,negative,neutral

it seems like it is just the norm now. that there aren’t any real rewardss. if you spend more you’re expected to spend more to get the rewardss whereas people who don’t shop at woolworths regularly have to spend lower amounts to get rewardsed. you get rewardsed if you leave woolworths and then come back which a lot of people actually do to get the rewardss.,neutral,neutral,negative
